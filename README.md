# Rocketseat Bootcamp - challenge 01

In this challenge I created a project using:
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)


## What I did:
- Created a simple form with an age field
- Crested a user age check that redirects to a specific page based on age
- Renders a text based on user age
- Created a midleware that redirects to the homepage if no age query param was set
